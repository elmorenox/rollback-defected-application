The Story
---------

Weâ€™re a tech start-up company with a URL shortener tool. We have a SLA with Nike to provide them access to our URL shortener. In the SLA, we are only allowed 20 minutes of downtime a year. If anything happens to the URL shortener, we must communicate any incidents to Nike.

Scenario
--------

A new hire was tasked with updating the URL shortener. The new hire committed version 2 of the application to the main branch. Which automatically triggered a build, test, and deploy to the production server, replacing version 1 of the application running on the server.

## Post Mortem

### Incident

An over permissioned engineer was able to push changes to the Main branch. The code had a defect which resulted in an unhandled exception, and crash in the application. The server returned a 500 error page to the end user.

### Down Time: 6mins

### Resolution

A Site Reliability Engineer was able to look at logs from Elastic Beanstalk and identify the issue with the code. A json object was incorrectly being read with ``json.loads``, which is used to convert a json string to a dictionary. The SRE corrected by using ``json.load``, which is used to convert a json file to a dictionary.

**Resolution improvements**

### Suggested Remediation

**Integration approval process**
Commits and merges into the main branch should require a pull request and successful Jenkins test and build.

- Task: Add Branch Protection Rule
  - Navigate to the repostiories GitHub settings
  - Click on 'Branches'
  - Click on 'Branch Protection rules'
  - Add the settings included in below and click 'Create' after selection

**Knowing builds will fail before deploying**
Congfigure behaviors on Jenkins to let Devops and Engineers know the state of PR branch build and branch integrations into Main.

- Task: Configure Jenkins to only build branches with a Pull Request
  - Navigate to the Jenkins Dashboard
  - Select the pipeline for this application
  - Click configuration
  - Under "Behaviors" configure the following strategies:

  - The first behavior will tell Jenkins to only build branches with pull requests. The second behavior will tell Jenkins to build a branch with a PR on it's own and build the result of merging the PR branch into main.
